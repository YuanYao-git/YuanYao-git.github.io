## 中文:
 中国大学生工程实践与创新能力大赛，在我们学校的竞赛目录上算是A类竞赛，这个竞赛是由工程训练A这门课的老师来指导的。所谓工程训练，就是我们能实际动手加工一些零件。和其他很多院校都是精工小锤子不同，这门课的大作业是开放性加工，并且推荐我们把作业和比赛结合起来做。 工创赛的要求是用机械结构做出一个带有自动转向功能的小车，要求能按照特定的路线行驶。  
 
 我们结合了网上的一些资料，设计了一个三级减速，用凸轮机构转向的小车， 因为先前的成图大赛经历，设计和制图的任务基本是我一个人完成的。都说干非标设计锻炼人，没想到这么麻烦，光是标准件，就有一百多件，一个个选型，当时还没有学机械设计和机械精度，我们做的东西又有些类似于玩具，尺寸限制的很紧，很多材料用的又是亚克力板，和学的金属有很大区别。举一个例子，我们的设计中，用的是10mm的光轴，在这个大小下，齿轮和轴的连接完全没办法像传统设计一样用键连接，因为国标中没有这个尺寸的键和键槽，同时我们也没办法用阶梯轴来定位，因为尺寸的变化会产生应力集中，进一步削减本就很细的轴的强度和刚度。 最后在查阅相关资料后总算是找到了shf系列的紧固件，通过在齿轮上开孔的方式用螺纹完成了轴和齿轮的连接。 小车的加工和装配也是个大麻烦，标准件虽然有多又杂，总归还能买，非标件可是得请学校里的师傅加工，要是哪里设计不合理了，是要被师傅骂的。我还记得我设计的前叉是不规则的方板和圆柱的结合，当时我还以为加工中心一趟直接就能车铣出来，师傅也没和我们说，分别加工了圆柱和方板，再用过盈配合硬装进去了。加工确实方便了，但也导致我们圆柱上的孔对齐精度很低，小车总不能按照预计好的路线前进，后来又将过盈配合硬生生拆装了好几次，才算有些起色。除此之外，我们还不得不学会了电钻钻孔，焊接电路等等操作，总不能一点点小活也老是请师傅帮忙。

小车能跑了，这时候面临了另外一个挑战，因为疫情的原因比赛延期到了第二学期，那个时候我已经出发去日本做交换生了，我们只能临时换了组长。后面的故事我就是听说了，我们组在校赛顺利通过后因为省赛题目的要求不同，需要重新设计一辆小车。这辆小车在试跑的时候表现都挺不错，省赛当天跑着跑着冒烟了，没跑完比赛，就只能带着遗憾止步省赛了，最后拿了省赛一等奖。让我意外的是，他们最后还是把我的名字放在了参赛人员的第二位而不是之前说好的最后一位，也在这里感谢一下另外三位参与的同学。

The Chinese College Students Engineering Practice and Innovation Ability Competition is classified as an "A-level competition" in our university's competition catalog. This competition is guided by the instructors of the "Engineering Training A" course. The so-called engineering training refers to the opportunity for students to actually machine and process some parts. Unlike many other universities that focus on fine crafts like small hammers, the final project for this course at our school is open-ended machining, and we are encouraged to combine the project with the competition.

For the competition, the requirement was to design a small vehicle with an automatic steering mechanism capable of traveling along a specific route.  

We referred to some resources online and designed a three-stage reduction system with a cam mechanism for steering. Since I had prior experience from the drawing competition, I was mainly responsible for the design and drafting work. People often say that working on non-standard designs is a great way to develop skills, and I didn’t realize how challenging it would be. Just selecting the standard components alone was a daunting task, as there were over a hundred of them. At that time, we hadn’t yet studied mechanical design or precision engineering, and the things we built were more akin to toys with tight size constraints. Moreover, many of the materials we used were acrylic sheets, which were quite different from the metals we were familiar with.  

For instance, in our design, we used a 10mm smooth shaft. At this size, it was impossible to connect the gears to the shaft using a traditional key connection because the national standards didn’t provide keys and keyways for that size. We also couldn’t use a stepped shaft for positioning since the change in diameter would cause stress concentration, further reducing the already limited strength and rigidity of the thin shaft. Eventually, after consulting related references, we found SHF series fasteners and achieved the gear-to-shaft connection by creating threaded holes in the gears.  

Machining and assembling the small vehicle turned out to be another headache. Although standard components were numerous and diverse, they were at least purchasable. Non-standard parts, however, had to be machined by the workshop technicians at the university. If there was any flaw in the design, we would often be scolded by the technicians. I still remember the front fork I designed, which combined an irregular square plate with a cylindrical shaft. I initially thought it could be directly milled and turned in one go using a CNC machine. However, without informing us, the technician processed the square plate and the cylindrical shaft separately and then used interference fitting to force them together. While this approach simplified machining, it resulted in poor alignment of the holes on the cylinder. As a result, the small vehicle couldn’t follow the planned route properly. Later, we had to disassemble and reassemble the interference fit several times before we saw some improvement.  

Apart from this, we also had to learn how to drill holes with a power drill, weld circuits, and perform other tasks ourselves. After all, it wouldn’t make sense to constantly bother the technicians for every small task.

The small vehicle was finally operational, but another challenge soon arose. Due to the pandemic, the competition was postponed to the second semester. By that time, I had already departed for Japan as an exchange student, so we had to temporarily appoint a new team leader. What happened afterward, I only heard from the others. 

After successfully passing the campus-level competition, our team faced new challenges in the provincial competition. The requirements for the provincial competition were different, so the team had to redesign the vehicle from scratch. The new vehicle performed quite well during the test runs, but on the day of the provincial competition, it started smoking midway through the run and failed to complete the race. Unfortunately, the team had to stop there, but we still managed to earn the provincial first prize.

What surprised me most was that, despite my absence during the second phase, they still listed my name as the second team member instead of putting me at the bottom as previously discussed. For that, I am sincerely grateful to the three other team members who continued to work hard and made this achievement possible.
