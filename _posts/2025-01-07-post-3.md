　　全国大学生创新创业训练计划，是教育部针对本科生设立的一项科研训练项目，旨在通过导师指导和团队合作培养学生的科研能力和创新思维。我有幸参与了这一计划，与团队中的其他四名成员共同完成了一个历时近两年的科研项目。最终，我们的项目荣获了该计划的最高荣誉——国家级优秀结题，这其中也离不开指导老师和师兄们的帮助。<br>
　　这个项目从大二开学时就慢慢开始筹备了。到结题有将近两年的时间，我们的研究目标是开发一个可用于划痕测试的超声振动辅助装置，核心是一个工作在超声频率下的振动发生器。我的任务是设计装置结构、进行初步测试，并验证其功能性。<br>
　　如图1所示，装置的振动源采用了市售的超声换能器，它通过施加电压产生机械振动。我们的设计任务是将这一圆柱形换能器稳定固定，并使振动能够有效传递至样品，同时确保装置能兼容划痕测试仪器。在夹紧固定部分，我咨询了曾指导过我的工图老师后，采用了V型槽加螺纹顶紧的方案。为实现样品的找平，我在换能器的零振幅平面设计了一个环形槽用于微调；此外，通过双头螺柱连接换能器和载物台，确保结构稳固和功能优化。加工完成后，我进行了基本的振幅测试，并撰写了一篇实用新型专利。虽然实用新型专利的学术要求不算高，但这次写作也算是我科研写作的起点。

　　项目立项答辩顺利通过后，我们获得了国家级项目的支持，并取得了一万元的研究经费。此时，我已申请上了日本东北大学的交换项目，正在等待签证。然而项目进行到有限元仿真阶段时遇到了瓶颈：队友们在尝试了两周后仍未解决问题，而组内师兄们也也没有做过类似的仿真。在这种情况下，我接手了这一部分任务，开始学习使用有限元仿真软件Abaqus。在一周多的学习和实践后，我成功完成了载物台长度参数的调整，将整个模块的共振频率优化至与换能器的工作频率一致的20kHz。后续的实验结果也与我的仿真分析高度吻合，为设计的合理性提供了一定的验证。

　　在我出发前往日本进行交换学习后，这个项目主要由团队中的黄同学继续负责推进。最终的实验结果表明，我们的设计确实能够对划痕实验起到显著的辅助作用。项目结题时，黄同学还以此为基础撰写了一篇期刊论文，由于结项时间要求紧迫，论文发表在了一本开源期刊上。最终，我们的项目荣获了**国家级优秀结题**，也让我对科研工作有了个初步的认识。

The National Undergraduate Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program is a research training project established by the Ministry of Education for undergraduates. It aims to cultivate students' research skills and innovative thinking through faculty guidance and team collaboration. I was honored to participate in this program and worked with four other team members to complete a research project that lasted nearly two years. Eventually, our project won the program's highest honor—National Outstanding Project, thanks in no small part to the guidance of our mentor and the help from senior students in our lab.

This project started in the first semester of my sophomore year and took nearly two years to complete. The goal of our research was to develop an ultrasonic vibration-assisted device for scratch testing, with the core component being a vibration generator operating at ultrasonic frequencies. My role in the project was to design the structure of the device, perform initial testing, and validate its functionality.

As shown in Figure 1, the vibration source of the device was a commercially available ultrasonic transducer, which generates mechanical vibrations when voltage is applied to its electrodes. Our task was to design a mechanism to securely fix this cylindrical transducer and effectively transmit the vibrations to the sample while ensuring compatibility with the scratch testing instrument. For the clamping mechanism, I consulted my engineering graphics instructor (with whom I maintained a good relationship after participating in a graphics competition) and adopted a V-groove and threaded tightening solution. To ensure leveling of the sample, I designed an annular groove for fine adjustments at the zero amplitude plane of the transducer. Additionally, I used a double-headed stud to connect the transducer and the sample stage to achieve structural stability and optimal functionality. After manufacturing the device, I conducted basic amplitude tests and wrote a utility model patent. Although the academic requirements for utility model patents are relatively low, this experience marked the starting point of my academic writing.

After successfully passing the project proposal defense, we were awarded national-level funding with a research budget of 10,000 RMB. At this point, I had already been accepted into a student exchange program at Tohoku University in Japan and was waiting for my visa. However, the project encountered a bottleneck during the finite element simulation phase. My teammates spent two weeks attempting to solve the issue without success, and the senior students in our lab also lacked experience with similar simulations. In this situation, I stepped in to take over this part of the project and began learning the finite element simulation software Abaqus. After a little more than a week of learning and practice, I successfully adjusted the length parameters of the sample stage and optimized the module's resonance frequency to match the operating frequency of the transducer at 20kHz. The subsequent experimental results closely matched my simulation analysis, providing validation for the feasibility of our design.

After I left for Japan for the exchange program, the project was primarily led by my teammate Huang. The final experimental results demonstrated that our design indeed provided significant assistance in scratch testing. At the conclusion of the project, Huang wrote a journal paper based on our work, which was published in an open-access journal due to the tight deadline for project completion. Ultimately, our project was awarded the National Outstanding Project, an honor that marked a successful conclusion to our two years of effort and gave me a preliminary understanding of the challenges and rewards of research work.
