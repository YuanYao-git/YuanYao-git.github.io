　　第十五届“高教杯”全国大学生先进成图技术与产品信息建模创新大赛，作为我大学参加的第一个比赛，也是我唯一一个拿到国家级奖项的比赛，它留给我的印象还是很深刻的。  

　　最初接触这个比赛是在工程制图课上，当时老师向我们推荐了成图大赛。起初没有想太多，就抱着试一试的心态报名了。这个比赛考的就是对工程制图的理解，以
及二维三维建模软件的熟练程度。我们在课上学的建模软件是AutoCAD和CATIA，参加这个比赛，让我们知道其实有许许多多的cad软件，比如中望，caxa，又比如SolidWorks,ug,proe,ritho等等一众二维三维软件，时至今日，学的catia没有精通，反倒是SolidWorks成了最顺手的软件。这似乎也是很多参赛同学的一个共性——能够熟练掌握一两个软件的建模、装配和出图过程。

　　这里放几张我建的模型和出的工图，这个比赛的难度还是要比我们的考试高很多的，所以在有关工图的三门考试上，我都还算轻松的拿到了90分以上的成绩。另外，还有工程制图的课程设计，我们这些在比赛中拿到省赛二等奖及以上的同学直接免修了（寒假多了两周）。更重要的是，通过这个比赛，我对工程中的一些典型结构有了一些理解，也开始初步认识到加工与设计的关系，算是树立了一些工程意识。
　　
　　相关课程高分背后，必然是比拿到高分所需更多的训练，备战省赛和国赛的那一段时间，可以说是我大学最努力的一段时间了，大一升大二的暑假，我都是眼睛一睁，就开始画图了，印象最深刻的是，和朋友约好了去杭州玩，每天晚上都在画图，甚至在西湖的游船上也在画，想想也是挺有意思的。一共建了大概一百多套装配图，其实所谓的课程设计，也就是建这么其中的一套。

　　我们那一届在成图大赛上的表现都还不错，参加国家级比赛的同学全部都拿到了奖项，第二学期学校就批准建立了3D创客基地，算是半官方的一个社团吧，现在每届能吸引三四十位优秀的同学加入。社团的主要活动形式是培训，由老师授课和我们这些上届获奖的同学轮流讲解。我也主讲了三四次，一方面是为了志愿时长，一方面也确实是挺高兴能看到学校在这个竞赛上办的一届比一届好。<br>

　　很多我们自己琢磨出来的软件使用小技巧，还有一些网上比较少的软件功能，大家一起研究、分享，过程也很是有趣。我后面把自己讲的内容都录制了下来，放在了b站上，我学软件的时候，从b站上学了许多，就想着把自己的一些理解也给放上去，留给后来人。到现在相关的视频也有了四万多的播放量（2025/01）[**视频合集链接**](https://space.bilibili.com/1330787288/channel/collectiondetail?sid=4448394&spm_id_from=333.788.0.0)，让我印象深刻的是，还有一些其他学校的老师来视频下面提问，也算授人玫瑰，手有余香了。

　　The 15th "Higher Education Cup" National Advanced Graphics and Product Information Modeling Innovation Competition was the first competition I participated in during my university years, and it is also the only competition where I won a national-level award. It left a deep and lasting impression on me.

My first encounter with this competition was during the Engineering Graphics course, where our teacher introduced us to the competition. Without giving it much thought, I signed up with a "why not give it a try" mindset. The competition mainly tested participants' understanding of engineering graphics as well as their proficiency in 2D and 3D modeling software. In class, we had learned modeling tools like AutoCAD and CATIA. However, through this competition, I came to know that there is actually a wide variety of CAD software available, such as Zhongwang CAD, CAXA, SolidWorks, UG, ProE, Ritho, and many others. Looking back now, although I never fully mastered CATIA, SolidWorks ended up being the software I am most comfortable with. This seems to be a common experience among many participants—being able to proficiently handle the modeling, assembly, and drafting processes in one or two CAD software tools.

Here are some of the models I built and the engineering drawings I produced. This competition was significantly more challenging than our regular exams, which made the three related engineering drawing exams much easier for me—I achieved scores above 90 in all of them. Additionally, for the Engineering Graphics course project, those of us who achieved a second prize or higher at the provincial level in the competition were directly exempted from the course (which meant an extra two weeks of vacation during the winter break). More importantly, this competition gave me some understanding of typical structures in engineering and helped me begin to grasp the relationship between manufacturing and design. It also helped me build a foundational awareness of engineering.

The high grades in the related courses were backed by training that went far beyond what was required to achieve those grades. The time spent preparing for the provincial and national competitions was probably the hardest I ever worked during university. During the summer between my freshman and sophomore years, I spent every day from the moment I woke up drawing and modeling. One of the most vivid memories from that time was a trip to Hangzhou with a friend—I kept working on my drawings every evening and even while on a boat on West Lake. Looking back, it was a tough yet interesting experience. Over that summer, I built around a hundred assembly drawings in total. In fact, the so-called course project was just one of those assemblies.

Our cohort performed quite well in the competition. Every participant in the national competition won an award, and the school approved the establishment of a "3D Maker Base" the following semester. It's a semi-official club that now attracts around 30 to 40 outstanding students each year. The main activities of the club focus on training, with lessons taught by teachers and former competition winners like us. I delivered three or four lectures myself, partly to earn volunteer hours and partly because it was genuinely rewarding to see the competition grow stronger each year at our school.

We also discovered and shared many software usage tips and functions that are not widely covered online. The process of exploring and sharing this knowledge was both enjoyable and enriching. Later, I recorded the content I taught and uploaded it to Bilibili. When I was learning software, I benefited a lot from resources on Bilibili, so I wanted to contribute my own understanding to help others. As of now (January 2025), those videos have accumulated over 40,000 views.[**This is link for the contents**](https://space.bilibili.com/1330787288/channel/collectiondetail?sid=4448394&spm_id_from=333.788.0.0).What left a deep impression on me was that some teachers from other universities even came to the comment section of the videos to ask questions. It felt like a true embodiment of the saying, "To give roses to others is to leave the fragrance in your own hands."
