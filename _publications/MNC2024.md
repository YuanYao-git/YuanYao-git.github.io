Summary: The feasibility of using stealth laser dicing on the two-dimensional patterned path was investigated.The relationship between laser scanning pitch and shear force/stress was measured and the morphology of the 2D laser-damaged area was analyzed. The obtained shear strengths under 100 MPa indicate that 2D stealth laser dicing may be used to develop a film separation technique.
