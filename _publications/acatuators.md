Abstract: Ultrasonic vibration-assisted machining is a promising technique for improving the removability of materials, especially for difficult-to-machine materials, but the material removal mechanism under ultrasonic vibration status is still far from clear. Scratch testing is generally employed to study the material removal mechanism, but currently, there is a lack of instruments capable of performing scratch testing under ultrasonic vibration. To address this gap, this study developed an ultrasonic vibration scratch tester that can perform quantitative ultrasonic vibration-assisted scratch (UVAS) testing of materials. A prototype was designed and fabricated, followed by characterizing its performance parameters. Comparative experiments of conventional scratch (CS) testing and UVAS testing were performed on AL1050 to investigate the effects of ultrasonic vibration on scratch characteristics, such as the scratch depth and coefficient of friction. It was found that compared to CS testing, UVAS testing, with an amplitude of 1.45 um and a frequency of 20 kHz, achieved a maximum reduction in the coefficient of friction of approximately 22.5% and a maximum increase in the depth of the residual scratch of approximately 175%. These findings confirm the superiority of ultrasonic vibration-assisted machining and demonstrate the requirement for the development of ultrasonic vibration scratch testers.
