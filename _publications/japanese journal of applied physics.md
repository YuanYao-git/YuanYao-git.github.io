Abstract: Laser lift-off (LLO) technology is widely used to separate ultra-thin electronic devices and in advanced packaging but typically relies on a specialized laser-responsive layer, adding complexity. This paper presents an innovative take on stealth dicing by using a pulse laser in a two-dimensional plane to create a separation interface without requiring a special layer,thus simplifying the fabrication process. The relationship between shear strength and laser ablation parameters was analyzed through shear force tests, with the modified layer morphology also examined. Shear strength for separation ranged from 200 to 20 MPa, with lower values achieved by reducing scanning pitch, increasing laser power, or enlarging the separated area. These findings highlight the potential of 2D stealth dicing as an LLO technique for ultra-thin devices.
